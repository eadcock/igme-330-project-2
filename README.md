## Summary
[INSERT CLEVER GAME TITLE HERE] was originally a sound-based stealth game. Many of those elements still exist in the final product. The player must navigate a maze filled with enemies, and every element of the maze reacts to the currently playing music! We have three levels, using songs of various tempos to simulate difficulty levels.

## A. Overall Quality of Experience/Impact
1. The visuals are simple by design. The players gains information in a way akin to echolocation. We want everything to feel clean, simple, and never give the player more information than they need to descern their immediate surroundings. Enemy types can break this theme, but overall we want a simple, clean interface.
1. Boy I hope so
1. It takes everything we did in class and builds upon it in a unique and interesting ways, such as the expanding circle and sound bar walls.
1. Clean, simple, effective B)

## B. User Experience
1. All of our controls will be within canvas to keep a coherent theme. The player will be introduced with a simple start button. 
1. A splash screen will appear telling the player the basic controls. Here the player can select their difficulty. Once the game starts, a help button will forever be in the top right corner if the player needs any additional help. A pause menu will also let the player back out and access additional options such as volume.
